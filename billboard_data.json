But that's where we are, that's my job, and that's what I'm gonna do. But first, let me take a selfie.  Yes, The Chainsmokers. Or as they will always be known to me: The #SELFIE Guys. I am more shocked about their comeback than I was for Mike Posner's, and Posner was gone for three times as long. #SELFIE was just from 2014. And what makes it so shocking is that #SELFIE is the definiton of a novelty hit. It was exactly the kind of song that I should be able to dismiss as a blip from two idiots I would never see again. Of course, I've been wrong about the career prospects of a lot of people, like, say, LMFAO, but they had their second song in the same year. If The Chainsmokers couldn't immediately follow up on their big hit, how on Earth could they return two years later?  I'm annoyed by a lot of things about their comeback, but most of all, I'm annoyed that I have to start taking them seriously as artists. The #SELFIE Guys are, in a quantifiable sense, the biggest act of the year. The Chainsmokers. If I could go back to 2014 and tell my past self that 2016 was the year of The Chainsmokers, past me would probably say, \"Wow, 2016 must be the worst in history!\" And I'd tell him, \"Calm down! Things aren't that bad, hahaha, hahaha, also start investing in Xanax. And I mean now, not later.\" The big question is: \"How do you turn #SELFIE into a sustainable career?\" Good question! Well, apparently by switching from making terrible novelty EDM to terrible generic EDM... that's one possible way.  This was  one of the biggest hits of the year, and it is a disaster. Its an incoherent mish-mash of the worst sounds in pop music, and it of course was everywhere. The Black Eyed Peas may have been banished, but will.i.am's influence remains. But even that was dwarfed by today's song, which is A.) their attempt at a love song and B.) one where they actually sing. That's right, The #SELFIE Douches are now singing.  Oh... boy... Calvin Harris, I apologize.  Your voice is lovely, like the song of a beautiful wood thrush wafting on a summer breeze. And because nothing in this world makes sense anymore, this song is huge. It is the best charting hit of the year. And, not speaking for myself, just taking the temperature of the room here, seems like the backlash is kicking in, but hard! And goddamn, I'm not surprised. 'Cause, Jesus Christ, who on Earth thought this was a good idea? I daresay there's not a more disliked song in the world right now! Am I really gonna be the guy to stand up for this? Fine, screw it. I like the song. Quite a bit, if I'm being honest, but hear me out; I totally get why this song is controversial. There are a lot of problems with it. A lot! I mean, first off, Jesus Christ, it's a duet... with Halsey!  And, speaking of artists who made a terrible first impression! I was introduced to Halsey last year with her first mainstream success, \"New Americana,\" an anthem for the new millennial generation. Yeah, listen to that. Feel the creeping dread of the sweeping tide of change!  We are the new Americana High on legal marijuana We smoke weed, legally! Watch us, obeying the law!  Raised on Biggie and Nirvana That's not even your generation's music! If anything, those are two artists whose influences are being felt less and less! That has nothing to do with your generation, you're just trying to make the rest of us feel old! Yeah, every impression I got was that Halsey was like if Kesha was trying to be Lorde, which is not a combo that works.  But I gathered that was a fluke, and she's actually much more an anonymous singer than that, like she's not trying to make a statement, she's just another boring singer. So yeah, I don't like her, she was another demerit against \"Closer\". But I do like it anyway. Mostly, I like that it's such a songwriterly song. I don't know the last time we had a hit song packed with this much lyrical detail and intense emotion. It sketches a very full portrait of a very complex relationship between two people. And that level of detail is really remarkable in a day and age where you can have a hit song that just says \"Pineapple, pen, apple.\"  Or \"You ugly, you ugly.\"  And in it, the two of them are playing specific roles in the song. They're two long broken up exes reconnecting despite the years of tension between them. Todd: I, I should really just play the chorus here, because it is just fantastic! Andrew and Halsey: So baby pull me closer In the backseat of your Rover That I know you can't afford  Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder  We ain't ever getting older Todd: Okay, not that fantastic. Go back. Andrew and Halsey: Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder  Sorry. I do keep an actual record player down here  for uh, for when I need that sound. But um, anyway, yeah. I think it's important to say that lyrical detail is great. It adds a lot. But, not all details help paint the picture you're trying to create. For example...  ...I didn't need to know about Pat Monahan's manscaping habits. Pat: My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest Not important to the story. Back to \"Closer\" Andrew and Halsey: Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Todd (VO): Now, for example, the shoulder tattoo, that's an important detail, it adds to the scene. Andrew and Halsey: Backseat of your Rover The Land Rover. Well, you know, it's part of the setting. Andrew and Halsey: That I know you can't afford Can she pay for it?  ...Um?  I, I guess it adds a level of familiarity with each other? ...But the mattress! Oh boy. Andrew and Halsey: Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder Do I need to know that there's a mattress? Yeah, that's uh, it's pretty important. But I don't need to know where she got the mattress, I don't need to know who she got the mattress from, and I certainly don't need to know where the person she got the mattress from is from! And it happens right before the most important line! Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older We ain't ever gettin' older That's what we were building up to! Except right before we hit peak momentum... mattress?! Boulder?! What?! Video of a bicycle race We're right at what should be the chorus's triumphant climax, and then... The song plays over a cyclist riding a bike... Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder ...and he falls off. Andrew and Halsey: From your roommate back in Boulder  This is the clumsiest, most useless, most jarringly unnecessary detail I've ever seen a writer use! And I've read  Dan Brown! And the fact that they're both singing the chorus together? Andrew and Halsey: Baby pull me closer In the backseat of your Rover That also raises some questions. Can they both not afford a Land Rover? Do they both have shoulder tattoos, are they both mattress thieves?  But, the fact that it's a duet makes some interesting things happen. Most especially, I like the fact that despite how they're sharing this moment together... these two people are having wildly different experiences! Andrew: Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you I drink too much, and that's an issue But I'm okay I mean, the first thing the guy sings is basically...\"Go away, I hate you!\"  Andrew: Tell your friends it was nice to meet them But I hope I never see them again Meanwhile, let's see how she feels about this rekindling of that old flame. Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you I forget just why I left you I was insane Why did you leave him? Hmm... Well, he hates all your friends! Andrew: But I hope I never see them... I'm not saying it's his fault or your fault, I'm just saying it's a huge red flag as far as compatibility goes. And of course, there's this. Andrew: I drink too much, and that's an issue Just a guess. But then again, by his own words, it's okay. Andrew: But I'm okay So, I mean, don't worry about that obviously.I mean, focus on what's bringing the two of you together again. Halsey: You look as good as the day I met you Ah, yes! The one thing that proves a relationship can work forever: looks! It's like they say, \"Beauty is bone deep.\" I, I don't know how to break it to ya... but I wouldn't count on him calling you the day after. Andrew: Four years, no calls Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar I mean, you haven't spoken in four years, which is not a good sign on its own. Plus, I get the feeling you might've forgotten some bad memories. I mean, Christ, you've re-met at a bar! The two of you only got back together because he's drunk! He drinks too much! It's an issue! Halsey: I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke down car, and This girl has completely missed that this guy's carrying more baggage than  a Samsonite store. Christ, the couple in  \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" were more on the same page! Kimbra: Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over I think these two crazy kids are gonna work it out!  Ah, young love. Andrew: I know it breaks your heart And even when they sing \"It breaks your heart,\" one's being completely sincere and the other's completely sarcastic. I mean, I guess it's kind of a dick move that the Chainsmokers wrote the girl as like being,  \"Wow, you're so hot,\" and... he never has to meet her halfway, he's just like \"You're a bitch,\" and she's just like,  \"God, sorry I'm crazy!\" Halsey: I was insane But, it, it still feels real, you know? The, the willful delusion of it all. See, it is a good song. Halsey: Stay, and play that Blink-182 song That we beat to death in Tucson, okay  O-okay, I got questions again. Halsey: In Tucson, okay First off, Boulder? Tucson? What the hell was the two of you's relationship?! Were you traveling around the country like Bonnie and Clyde on a crazy mattress-stealing spree Secondly, \"that Blink-182 song\"? Halsey: Play that Blink-182 song Which one, the one with the dick jokes?  Mark Hoppus: The state looks down on sodomy I know, I know, I'm sorry,  I know they became a real grown-up band eventually.  But to me, they'll always be the  \"Haha, that porn star's gonna stick a finger up your butt\" band. Which, which song are they even talking about?  Let's see here.  Oh yeah, \"I Miss You.\" Yeah that's a good song. I like that song. Tom deLonge: Don't waste your time on me You're already the voice inside my head Not sure it's all that romantic though. Not sure \"Don't waste your time on me\" is the lyric you really wanna hear when reconnecting. But yeah it does have some of the same  wistful vibe that this song has, you know, I'll give it that. Of course, if anything... the Blink-182 song she's talking about is still \"What's My Age Again?\" because that song is indeed about never getting older. Mark: I never wanna act my age  And be honest, the situation will probably end up for these two looking like the same way it did for Blink. Embarrassing and regrettable in hindsight. This hookup is a mistake, you guys.  But I do have one other question:  Why is this being labelled a millennial anthem? 'Cause I've seen that a lot. I've been thinking about it, and... I think it's that a lot of the unnecessary jarring details are about... one major thing. Andrew: Moved to the city in a broke down car and  Can't buy a mattress, Daddy bought us a car, this is the new Americana. We're all broke. And we're gonna be a lot broker pretty soon, probably!  Oh no, no, no politics, no politics, no politics.   Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older  Yeah, regardless of all its deep, serious flaws, I like it. I mean she's singing way too hard, and he can't sing at all, but... it works together, you know? Like Sonny & Cher, who are also both terrible singers; don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Andrew and Halsey: We ain't ever gettin' older Look, I'm not saying it's a perfect song, I'm not sure it's even a good song. But if there's anything that sums up the mess of anger, optimism, confusion, and the desire to turn back time that I'm feeling right now, it's this one. Chainsmokers, \"Closer,\"... thumbs up.

The land where black people aren't seen as people or respected as humans. Rather treated inferior & handled as beasts from the east & not with ease Our inputs taken for granted. Our lives taken for granted. Our children's futures doubted, and our minds literally ousted 13% of peoples. Smaller than a small fraction, but bigger than the big picture. A group of people so small with an impact so vast, you'd think we was more than we are. We really are & We always find a way. From the brutal whip wielding slavery, to segregated buses, We made it all the way. All the way from the fields, to the house. till we claimed our freedom, made it out the house & made our way To the White House Yeah See they seek to oppress, but our heads are upheld. I wonder how we manage to last with how they keep killing us, but we won't digress & we won't be repressed, we've shown you before, we can't be oppressed  Over a thousand unarmed black peoples was killed by cops in the year 2015. Minorities killed in majority. My hands are up, I can't breathe, I need love  RAP PRELUDE: It's Lotta hate. It's a Lotta prejudice. A Lotta bullshit. A lotta racism The shit We're subjected to, I just can't understand it I can't, I can't  phantom the thought or ideology of hating a fellow human based off the color of their skin, that shit is a sin. The shit is obscene & I'm here to shed light on what matters & let y'all know that black lives matter. It's 2017, & we gotta make a change. We want peace  VERSE 1: It's been way too many years that we've been enslaved. Now It's time to air it out, put it on display. I don spent too many years of witnessing this pain. Now I'm fighting, believing that we make a change. I been losing my mind I'm drowning in my faith. Now I'm hoping that Jesus can make me walk on water. Lord I'm gon need signs you hear us at this hour. & I'm gon need yeezus to help this propaganda 20\/20 election it won't even matter. But Dead or alive our opinions gotta matter. I took a peek in my mind, it's Plenty bullets flying through it & I'm way too educated, I can't bullet proof it  Every time we try to make a change, they sabotage us. When we do it anyways they annihilate us. It's the same white folks that claim that all lives matter, but passed laws that made us slaves so we could call em masta  The ones that raped our wives & sold our sons away. Yeah that was years back then, that shit ain't go away. Cos It ain't too long ago they burned out black bodies, whipping, hanging, mutilating niggas just to raise their crops. Now they don't hang us, they locking us away. Yeah they don't lynch us, they shooting us on sight. Kill us more than diseases & cause our loss of life. Yeah it hurts way more to bring the past to light  But it ain't gon change if we don't talk about it. & It won\u2019t go away if we ain't acting on it. I'm eating Black-eyed peas, just asking where's the love? Why they shoot us in the back Just like Walter Scott? Why they take away our freedom, making us insane? Then they label us as thugs for setting cars in flames. Ill take a page up out your book & read it right back. Quit being a bully & give my rights back  INTERLUDE: You know we've got Single mothers in the ghetto struggling to make a living & raise their kids, and a prejudice motherfucker on a random day pulls the trigger & ends their pride & joy. Tamir rice, Freddie Grey, Rekia Boyd. Darrien hunt was Shot 6 times from behind as he was running away  Michael brown in Ferguson. 2 bullets to the head, shot from behind, 4 in his right arm Jonathan Ferrell was Shot 12 times at close range; the cop kept shooting while he was on the floor. Yeah that's some crazy shit. I can't relate to it  VERSE 2: When I heard of Michael Moore I couldn\u2019t take no more. Look at Trayvon Martin that boy was seventeen. All those years can't give his mom back. His daddy's tears can't get his son back. Yet you sold that gun that took his son's life. Hundreds of thousands I'm calling y'all out. Murderous demons, clowns & all that  I wish that i could take this pain & give it all back. Grab a couple whips & whoop on y'all\u2019s backs. Put dem shackles on your feet & locks on y'all\u2019s mouths. Let you can see just how it feels when you just can't breathe & got the weight of evil spirits on your poor heart  Yeah you put us through these things just because we black. Damn mofuckas & still we ain't crack. And I\u2019ve still got love for the white race, but you better call me nigga from a safe place  BRIDGE: Huh Shits just sad mehn Lord help us It's already sad enough I had to lose a brother to cancer. Already bad enough i have to live with pain & hunger. Why do We have to be subjected to all the extra damnation to fuel this anger. We just need you to realize that our black lives matter  So Stop killing my people Please. Stop killing my people Stop killing my fucking people Arrrrrrgggghhhhhhhhhh (Yells)  OUTRO: I'm tired of mourning. I'm tired of crying. Tired of bleeding. Please believe that we're about 4, 5 miles away from the crossroads. You make us cross that line & you'll regret it. Killing our innocent babies. Locking up our innocent brothers  Same crime a white person commits & walks free, a black person commits & is locked deep. Deep in the coffers of the system. Correctional facilities, more like subjectional facilities. Designed to detain & maintain slavery under the premise of law & legality, with no immunity, but there'll be mutiny  I guarantee we'll make a stand & make demands for a brave heart's in great hands so make plans for the mayhem A Brave heart in grey hats led my people in formation on a great March that changed lives and sprung the end of a lawless law of open discrimination in this Nation  We have a dream We still believe In the King within I am King We are Kings We're not weak We will not blink We will not sleep We will not eat & Please believe we will not chill Until we're set free LET US BREATHE\u2026  The end","Rank":"10","Song Title":"Just Can't Get Enough","Year":2011.0},{"Artist":"Jennifer Lopez Featuring Pitbull","Lyrics":"JLo!

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation While rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard\u2019s Hot Rap Songs chart, we\u2019re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally\u2019s quarter-century history.

Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation While rap has evolved, there\u2019s no denying its ever-growing power.

Listen to the second verse while imagining Drake as a white, Southern, bro-country artist: \"Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though  Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw This life I live it might not be for you, but it's for me though\" Not only is the rhetoric Drake worthy \u2013 extolling the virtues of a uniquely superior lifestyle - but the way he rhymes \u201cthough\u201d using a slang pronunciation three times in close succession, why, it even sounds like Drake! On another track, their \u201cCruise Remix\u201d video featuring Nelly, Florida Georgia Line also supply imagery indicative of their genre-blending.  While some rap music has long been short-sightedly accused of focusing on cash, cars, drugs, and women, FGL show that this is redneck thematic territory as well; just observe the expensive rides and seductively southern dames: Likewise, through artful alliteration, the boys name-drop their party drink as well: \"She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker\" And this is all before we get to Nelly\u2019s impassioned verse, which he contributes, according to the video\u2019s opening scene, to help them learn how to \u201cturn up.\u201d Judging by \u201cThis Is How We Roll\u201d as a follow-up, it is obvious FGL have learned the lesson well \u2013- so well that they have been influenced even by the structure of Hip-Hop, bringing in one of their homies for a guest verse: Luke Bryan, himself known to get turnt by mixing a little Conway with some T-Pain every once in a while. Some people, though, are instead turning this trend down. While peeping their video on YouTube reveals over 16 million views (as of 7\/17\/14), the comments section is filled with vitriolic rants.  One such comment puts it this way: \u201cHick-Hop. Manufactured, lame, corporate horse crap. This is a disgrace to country music. Johnny Cash is rolling over in his grave right now.\u201d Really? The same Johnny Cash who was the OG Southern thug!  The same Johnny Cash who put so much conviction into singing lines like: \"I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down\" \"When I was arrested I was dressed in black\" \"I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die\" We\u2019re talking the \u201cMan In Black\u201d himself! I think he\u2019d welcome the chance, were he still alive, to pal around with some new school gangsters, and, presented with an opportunity for a remix, would probably choose to turn up instead of turn it down!","Rank":"9","Song Title":"Cruise","Year":2013.0},{"Artist":"Katy Perry","Lyrics":"null","Rank":"10","Song Title":"Roar","Year":2013.0},{"Artist":"Bruno Mars","Lyrics":"(One, two, one, two, three) Aw, yeah yeah Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!

Well\u2026 Lil Wayne has a new single, and it\u2019s called \u201cLove Me\u201d. Well, with a title like that, I don\u2019t know what to expect. However, after \u201cHow to Love\u201d turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life, maybe a song titled \u201cLove Me\u201d would be a more personal number. Contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships. And yeah, it could just be another crappy bragging song, but I like to be optimistic when I go into a review. So... what? That\u2019s not the full title of the song? What\u2019s the full title of the song? Drake: Bitches love me Man, I feel stupid. Well, let\u2019s get this over with Future: I\u2019m on that good kush and alcohol -stupid, unnecessary audio watermark for the producer- *sneers* I don\u2019t know what I was doing- Wait. What was that thing she\u2019s wearing? Is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle? A mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much? Wow, we\u2019ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory, haven\u2019t we? I mean\u2026 you know what, I haven\u2019t even started talking about the lyrics yet. I\u2019m just gonna let this one go Okay, so this song, which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit, is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex. And\u2026maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff! Like, you know, headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now. Or swing sets. Yeah\u2026 Future: Imma ball \u2018til the day I fall One more thing before we continue. When did this Future character here, a guy who barely passes as a rapper, let alone a singer, become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy? I mean, according to what I\u2019m seeing on the lyric sheet, he has no verse! So without his own full verse, the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook. And I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, but\u2026 (shows a cover of the single for \u201cLoveeee Song\u201d by Future and Rihanna as that song plays) Future isn\u2019t exactly a powerhouse vocalist. I mean, could Lil Wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks? Aren\u2019t you still friends with T-Pain? At least that guy has some personality, this guy is\u2026 huh. Funny that a guy named Future is relying on a vocal effect that\u2019s near extinction. I mean, when even T-Pain says... T-Pain: Auto tune is on its way out! Back in 2008, I think it\u2019s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously. But back to the song Drake: Long as my bitches love, my bitches love Wait, now Drake is on the chorus? Is this the Drake and Future collaboration the world was waiting for? He doesn\u2019t have a verse either, so I can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting. But forgive me again, we need to get back to the song Drake: I can give a fuck \u2018bout no hater Long as my bitches love me So the song is about how he doesn\u2019t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him. Which is typical, but for some reason, in this song he\u2019s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky, confident braggadocio. Actually listen to the song without the arrogant, too cool to care faces in the music video. And really listen to their voices: Future: I\u2019m on that good kush and alcohol I got some down bitches I can call Is there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess? I mean, if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is, that would be perfect, but it\u2019s not. And usually, failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that\u2019s full of vigor and 808, but he can\u2019t do that here, since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that\u2019s present on nearly every friggin\u2019 song featuring Drake, and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens, their lifeless delivery stops the song dead! Drake: I can give a fuck \u2018bout no hater Long as my bitches love me Does he actually sound convinced here? Does he legitimately sound like he doesn\u2019t care about haters? I don\u2019t know about you guys, but to me it sounds like he\u2019s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve. All I hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess! And we haven\u2019t even gotten to the verses yet! Lil Wayne: Pussy ass niggas, stop hating So, you don\u2019t care about haters in any way, shape or form, and only care about your women... but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters. Because you know, what better way to show that you don\u2019t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them? (montage of Wayne mentioning haters throughout the song) I don\u2019t know about you, but there\u2019s something slightly contradictory about shouting, \u201cHEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT YOU!\u201d Lil Wayne: Lil Tunechi got that fire And these hoes love me like Satan, man! D-do hoes like Satan? I mean, I know hoes are known for having questionable morality, but I don\u2019t think anyone actively likes Satan. I don\u2019t even think Satanists likes Satan, they just do it to piss off Christians. I mean I know you\u2019re trying to relate the Satan and fire thing, but hoes don\u2019t like fire either! Lil Wayne: And these hoes love me like Satan, man! You know, believe it or not, but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that Lil Wayne is part of some demonic cult. And honestly, if you think some post-production CGI inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think Lil Wayne works for the devil... then he does work for the devil... and he\u2019s going to kill you Lil Wayne: Fuck with me and get bodied And all she eat is dick, she\u2019s on a strict diet You don\u2019t know how segways work, do you? I mean, what thought process takes you from \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d to \u201cThis chick is all about my penis.\u201d For real! The only piece of transitional material we get is the word \u201cand\u201d. And I don\u2019t know about you, but linking two phrases together with the word \u201cand\u201d is not the same as a transitional phrase, and I like nipples Lil Wayne: She don\u2019t want money She wants the time we could spend Pfft. Yeah, okay. Lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you! Lil Wayne: She said, \u201cI never wanna make you mad I just wanna make you proud\u201d I said, \u201cBaby just make me cum Then don\u2019t make a sound\u201d Okay\u2026 I\u2019m, I\u2019m trying to explain what\u2019s wrong with these lines, and what disturbs me about them. Because it\u2019s not just about the fact that they\u2019re objectifying the girl in question. No, that\u2019s to be expected with Wayne. But it\u2019s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that. And I just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question: Lil Wayne: She said, \u201cI never wanna make you mad I just wanna make you proud\u201d I said, \u201cBaby just make me cum Then don\u2019t make a sound\u201d In what way does this NOT sound like an abusive relationship? In what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who\u2019s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her? I mean it\u2019s not overtly stating it, but it\u2019s definitely implied. (sees a shot of a woman in the scolds bridle) Wow. That is not helping. But anyway, in his episode of Behind the Music, he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him, and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that. If this is true, it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself. And you know what? He\u2019s an artist, and an artist telling you about his perspective doesn't always have to be a positive thing But my problem lies not in his questionable morals\u2026well actually yes it does, but it\u2019s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular, plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls! I mean, he\u2019s making no bones about the fact that he doesn\u2019t respect you, so at this point, if you\u2019re still trying to get with him, your motivations are probably no better than his, and I think you know what I mean when I talk about the motivations of these types of women. You know, those women, always wanting to spend all of your time\u2026 Lil Wayne: She wants the time we could spend *scoff* Heartless succubus. But hey, maybe he\u2019s not that bad. Maybe when he\u2019s with these women, he\u2019s actually respectful of the... I\u2019m sorry, are there women in cages like circus animals? So\u2026let me get this straight. Lupe Fiasco makes a song that barely charts, talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects, and should hold themselves to a higher standard, and he\u2019s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff. But Lil Wayne has a top 10 hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages?! With lines like... Lil Wayne: I said, \u201cBaby just make me cum Then don\u2019t make a sound\u201d And\u2026 nobody\u2019s making a stink about this! I\u2019m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything, I just think it\u2019s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on, while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay. But where was I? Oh, yes. So like I was saying, I\u2019m sure in real life, Wayne is very respectful to women\u2026 Lil Wayne: These hoes got pussies like craters Damn! That\u2026that imagery! Again, to all the women still wanting to have sex with Lil Wayne: THIS is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas! *picture of a crater* So\u2026I think he\u2019s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you\u2019re all whores! Lil Wayne: Can\u2019t treat these hoes like ladies, man! Hey\u2026who do you treat like a lady? Because by acknowledging the idea of lady, you\u2019re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status. But none of the girls you\u2019ve ever met have achieved that status in your head. So it\u2019s not that you\u2019re saying that all women are whores; you\u2019re just saying that all women you refer to are whores. Hmm... I wonder how that works for other things \"I\u2019m not saying that all Chinese people are good at math, play piano and know Kung Fu, I\u2019m just saying that all the Chinese people I\u2019m ever going to refer to are good at math, play piano and know Kung-where\u2019s everybody going?\" Lil Wayne: Pussy, money, weed, codeine Was that a lyric, or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to? Lil Wayne: She wake up, eat this dick Call that breakfast in bed: 69, 96 Wait. What do those last numbers have to do with anything? Are you saying that you and her are 69\u2019ing each other? Well that doesn\u2019t work, since you only mention that she\u2019s going down on you! And what is 96 supposed to mean?! Do you know why it\u2019s called 69, Wayne? Because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other. So what is 96 supposed to represent? Two people\u2026facing away from each other? What, are they lying on each other\u2019s butts? That makes no sense! Lil Wayne: I feel her heartbeat It\u2019s a little late to get romantic, don\u2019t you think? Lil Wayne: I chest to chest with this bitch Yeah, I thought so Lil Wayne: Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches But it\u2019s like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses Hold on a minute, maybe the song\u2019s trying to say something. Maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn\u2019t actually lead to a fulfilling life. And maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet! Of course there\u2019s no real revelation, he just continues to talk about haters and hoes Lil Wayne: Now kiss my ass if you hatin I\u2019m getting ass or I\u2019m skating Anything that keeps you from playing the guitar. *shows a scene of Wayne playing the guitar live* Yeah, keep hitting those two notes, buddy. I\u2019m sure the people who play the Beginner mode on Guitar Hero are impressed Yeah, overall, this gets a 0 out of 5 from me. The melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song, which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it. And the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat! And his rhymes are terrible. There\u2019s no wordplay here that\u2019s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist. It crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance. And ultimately, does not make for a good listening experience And that\u2019s pretty much all I have to say about that. Well, I\u2019m the Rap Critic. You don\u2019t have to like my opinion, but I don\u2019t have to like your song (post-outro scene) I don\u2019t know about you, but there\u2019s something slightly contradictory about saying, \u201cHEY, ALL YOU HATERS!

couple weeks I only wanna see her We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza Before a text message was the only way to reach her Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either But me and her, we make money the same way Four cities, two planes, the same day And those

yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely\" Once, I was seven years old  It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure  Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me \"Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely\" Once, I was eleven years old  I always had that dream like my daddy before me So I started writing songs, I started writing stories Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me 'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me  Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told Before the morning sun, when life was lonely Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)  I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure 'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major I got my boys with me, at least those in favor And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later  Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me Once, I was twenty years old  Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming Soon, we'll be thirty years old  I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry  Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one Remember life and then your life becomes a better one I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month  Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold? Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me? Soon, I'll be sixty years old Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold? Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?

It\u2019s the question almost everyone wants to argue about and the debate that never seems to end. And before you drop the \u201cHaram Police\u201d card and get ready to prepare an essay response in the comments, can I just say that I\u2019m not here to argue the different rulings and opinions on musical instruments, singing, beat boxing, drums and what not. I\u2019m not even going to go there. I\u2019m going to be doing something different. I want us to answer this question for ourselves, openly and honestly. In fact, we can even forget I even said the word Haram to begin with. Let\u2019s instead just ask the question \u201cIs Music harmful?\u201d And when we say music, I\u2019m going to be very blank, I\u2019m referring to the music that the majority of people are listening to today because that\u2019s what we should be concerned about. The music that\u2019s on our radios, TV\u2019s, phones and iTunes playlists on repeat. The songs that are topping the charts week-in-week-out and have us memorizing their lyrics from A-Z. This is the music I\u2019m referring to. Should we, as Muslims be fine listening to this stuff? Well, let\u2019s take a look for yourselves and decide. The Hot 100 Billboard Charts has these songs topping the charts for the current week.  Despacito: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber \u201cYou fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on Got the only key, know how to turn it on\u201d  Wild Thoughts: DJ Khaled, Rhianna, Bryson Teller \u201cI don\u2019t know if you could take it Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked\u201d  That\u2019s what I like: Bruno Mars \u201cGo pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me\u201d  I\u2019m the One: DJ Khaled, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, Quavo \u201cRoll my eyes And when she on the molly she a zombie\u201d  Unforgettable: French Montanna \u201cIf you loved the girl then I\u2019m so, so sorry I got to give it to her like we in a marriage No, no I won\u2019t tell nobody\u201d \u201cIf you want drama, Grab the Uzi\u201d.  A quick Google search of the lyrics of these songs will let you know exactly the kinds of messages they contain. You honestly don\u2019t have to read far until you come across references to drugs, sexual promiscuity, violence or alcohol. Even when lyrics can seem somewhat innocent, they are underlined with the most vulgar and shameless of meanings. And the saddest part of it all, there\u2019s even some Muslims actually making these songs. And yes, I\u2019m sure we can argue all day that not all songs are this bad and there are some \u201cgood songs\u201d out there, but the fact of the matter is the statistics speak for themselves when they mention that the vast majority of today\u2019s music is riddled with such references and as the day\u2019s go by content is only getting worse. And as I\u2019ve mentioned before, I\u2019m not here to argue the Islamic rulings on instruments and the various opinions of scholars on music, because, in all honesty, these opinions are irrelevant when we consider them in light of the music being listened to today. I mean, do you seriously want to argue the permissibility of instruments when Muslims are listening to Nicki Minaj? And we can go ahead and argue that we\u2019re strong and that the music isn\u2019t necessarily influencing us, but the fact of the matter is \u2013 it does. And whether you realize it or not, when you constantly grant such music free access to your ears, it is affecting you. It\u2019s normalizing the worst of sins to the point we can sing about them happily and joyfully. And if you were so sure that the things you listen to won\u2019t affect your life, why not switch up a music playlist with some Quran and see what change it would have in your life. Even if you don\u2019t understand a word being recited, just listen to it and see what kind of impact it will leave on your soul. There\u2019s no denying that our ears are gateways into our hearts and we should be very careful who we allow access to. And lastly, I know we all have shortcomings and weaknesses, and I know not all of us are the perfect ideal Muslims \u2013 but the least we can do is acknowledge that it\u2019s wrong so that perhaps we can start making an effort to change. May Allah help us all.","Rank":"2","Song Title":"Despacito","Year":2017.0},{"Artist":"Bruno Mars","Lyrics":"Hey, hey, hey! I got a condo in Manhattan Baby girl, what's happenin'?
